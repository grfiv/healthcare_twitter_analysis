          The link below brings up a D3.js choropleth map of US counties colored by unemployment rate 
          loaded from a tab-separated file.<br><br> The plan is to figure out how to use the FIPS data stored
          in the reverse-geo-tagged MongoDB documents for this project to search for any arbitrary 
          string in the database (words, hashtags, etc.) and plot their incidence on this same map
          in real time.<br><br>I have shown how to do background requests for data from the project's
          MongoDB database in the Interface tab and my thought is that this base technology will 
          allow all sorts of web-based analyses and visualizations.
